ðŸ§© Objective

Demonstrate real-time speech-to-speech translation using Metaâ€™s SeamlessStreaming model, deployed in Docker on a GCP Compute Engine VM, with a simple web client that streams microphone input and receives translated speech continuously.

ðŸªœ High-Level Task Plan
1. Environment Setup

Provision a GPU-enabled GCP Compute instance suitable for lightweight real-time inference.

Install Docker and enable GPU access for containers.

Open minimal required ports for secure browser communication (WebSocket or HTTPS).

2. Model Integration

Select the SeamlessStreaming model variant supporting live S2S translation.

Prepare a containerized environment including model dependencies (PyTorch, Transformers, audio I/O libraries).

Pre-load the model inside the container for faster startup and consistent inference.

3. Streaming Backend

Implement a lightweight backend (e.g., FastAPI with WebSocket support).

Maintain a persistent model session for streaming inference.

Handle continuous binary audio input, incremental translation, and synthesized speech output.

Use small time-windowed chunks for smooth, low-latency streaming.

Define basic message framing for language settings and control signals.

4. Web Client

Capture microphone audio in real time via the browserâ€™s Web Audio API.

Encode and stream small audio chunks to the backend over a WebSocket connection.

Receive translated audio chunks from the backend and play them immediately using browser audio APIs.

Keep UI minimal: start/stop control and language selection.

5. Real-Time Flow

User starts session in browser.

Browser streams microphone audio continuously to backend.

Backend processes incoming audio incrementally through SeamlessStreaming:

Speech recognition

Translation

Speech synthesis

Backend streams translated speech chunks back to browser for near-real-time playback.

6. Deployment

Package the backend and model into a single Docker image.

Deploy the container on the GPU-enabled GCP VM.

Expose the streaming endpoint securely for browser access.

Validate end-to-end latency and translation quality.

7. Optional POC Enhancements
Focus	Enhancement
User Experience	Display live transcribed text of input and translated output.
Audio Quality	Add buffering or overlap smoothing between audio chunks.
Languages	Allow configurable source/target language pairs.
Interactivity	Enable quick restart/reset of the translation stream.
